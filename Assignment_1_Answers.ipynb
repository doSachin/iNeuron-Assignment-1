    ">- String is a collection of alphabets, words or other characters. \n",
    ">- It is one of the primitive data structures and are the building blocks for data manipulation. \n",
    ">- Python has a built-in string class named str. \n",
    ">- Python strings are \"immutable\" which means they cannot be changed after they are created. \n",
    ">- For string manipulation, we create new strings as we go to represent computed values because of their immutable property.\n",
    ">- **Example:**\n",
    "            single_quote_string = 'Welcome to the \"iNeuron\".'\n",
    "            double_quote_string = \"I am  'Sachin', and I love to write codes.\"\n",

    "    \n",
    "> **`Variable:`**\n",
    ">- A variable is a label or a name given to a certain location in memory. This location holds the value you want your program to remember, for use later on.\n",
    ">- To create a new variable in Python, you simply use the assignment operator (=, a single equals sign) and assign the desired value to it.\n",
    ">- Assigning an initial value to a variable is called initializing the variable.\n",
    ">- **Example: **\n",
    "            variable_int = 7777\n",
    "            variable_string = \"8888\"\n",

    ">- Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. \n",
    ">- In Python,  everything is an object, therefore data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.\n",
    ">- Python is a dynamically typed language; hence we do not need to define the type of the variable while declaring it. The interpreter implicitly binds the value with its type.\n",
    ">- The vaious data types in Python are :\n",
    "        1. int,                2. float,                3. complex,                4. bool,                \n",

    "> **`1. Interger Data Type:`**\n",
    ">- In Python, integers are zero, positive or negative whole numbers without a fractional part and having unlimited precision, \n",
    ">- Integer data type is represented by int class. \n",
    ">- It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). \n",
    ">- In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.\n",
    ">- Integers can be binary, octal, and hexadecimal values.\n",
    ">- **`Examples:`** \n",
    "          i. first_1 = 10 (Normal positive integer value)\n",
    "         ii. second_2 = 35656222554887711  (Long positive integer value)\n",

    "        \n",
    " \n",
    "> **`2. FLoat Data Type:`**\n",
    ">- In Python, floating point numbers (float) are positive and negative real numbers with a fractional part denoted by the decimal symbol . or the scientific notation E or e WITH BASE 10.\n",
    ">- Floats has the maximum size depends on system. The float beyond its maximum size referred as \"inf\", \"Inf\", \"INFINITY\".. \n",
    ">- Float 2e400 will be considered as infinity for most systems.\n",
    ">- Scientific notation is used as a short representation to express floats having many digits. For example: 345.56789 is represented as 3.4556789e2 or 3.4556789E2\n",
    ">- **Examples:**\n",
    "            i. float_1 = 2.45 (valid)\n",
    "           ii. float_2=123_42.222_013 (valid)\n",

    "> **`3. String Data Type:`**\n",
    ">- The most commonly used data type is 'str' data type.\n",
    ">- The string can be defined as the sequence of characters represented in the quotation marks. \n",
    ">- In Python, we can use single, double, or triple quotes to define a string.\n",
    ">- In Python, strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters.\n",
    ">- In python, there is no character (i.e. char) data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.\n",
    ">- The operator (+) is used to  concatenation two strings and the asterisk (*) operator is the used for repetition of string.\n",
